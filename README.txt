When I started this project I grossly overvalued my programming skills.  Since then I've become much better, and I've seen how horrendous this "API" was made.  I was trying to remake stuff that shouldn't be remade.  So I've stopped developing this to save myself a bit of worry, and hopefully nobody ever makes the mistake I've made by doing this.

But, in fairness, the TreeData stuff (com.treyzania.api.io.treedat) is a little bit useful on its own, but there are better options, such as JSON or even XML if you're *really* crazy.
