We need help with...

- 3-D geometry.  If you have any idea how to make this easier I'd love it.
	- GET THOSE VECTORS WORKING! (Tait-Bryan angles)

- 3-D physics.  Just write something good.

- Change over the current coordinate system to use the standards.
	- "x/y" is horizontal now, I need it to be "x/z".  The "y" should be up.
	- You'll have to change a lot of rendering algorithms.

- Give me some server cods to work with.

- Anything else you can think of.
