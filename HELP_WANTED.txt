We need help with...

- 3-D geometry.  If you have any idea how to make this easier I'd love it.  (That code would go in the "Gamma" plotter.  I already have ideas for "Alpha" and "Beta"!)
	- GET THOSE VECTORS WORKING! (Tait-Bryan angles)

- 3-D physics.  Just write something good.

- Give me some server code to work with.

- Anything else you can think of.
